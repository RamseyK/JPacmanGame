The lower <code>h(n)</code> is, the more node A* expands, making it slower.</li><li>If <code>h(n)</code> is exactly equal to the cost of moving from <code>n</code>
 to the goal, then A* will only follow the best path and never expand 
anything else, making it very fast. Although you can’t make this happen 
in all cases, you can make it exact in some special cases. It’s nice to 
know that given perfect information, A* will behave perfectly.</li><li>If <code>h(n)</code> is sometimes greater than the cost of moving from <code>n</code> to the goal, then A* is not guaranteed to find a shortest path, but it can run faster.</li><li>At the other extreme, if <code>h(n)</code> is very high relative to <code>g(n)</code>, then only <code>h(n)</code> plays a role, and A* turns into Best-First-Search.</li></ul><div class="note" align="center"><strong>Note:</strong><br> Technically, the <strong>A*</strong> algorithm should be called simply <strong>A</strong> if the heuristic is an underestimate of the actual cost. However, I will continue to call it <strong>A*</strong> because the implementation is the same and the game programming community does not distinguish <strong>A</strong> from <strong>A*</strong>.<br></div><p>So
 we have an interesting situation in that we can decide what we want to 
get out of A*. At exactly the right point, we’ll get shortest paths 
really quickly. If we’re too low, then we’ll continue to get shortest 
paths, but it’ll slow down. If we’re too high, then we give up shortest 
paths, but A* will run faster.</p><p>In a game, this property of A* can 
be very useful. For example, you may find that in some situations, you 
would rather have a “good” path than a “perfect” path. To shift the 
balance between <code>g(n)</code> and <code>h(n)</code>, you can modify either one.</p></div><div class="h2banner"><h2 id="speed-or-accuracy">Speed or accuracy?</h2><div class="h2-curl-bottom"></div><div class="h2-curl-top"></div></div><div class="topic"><p>A*’s
 ability to vary its behavior based on the heuristic and cost functions 
can be very useful in a game. The tradeoff between speed and accuracy 
can be exploited to make your game faster. For most games, you don’t <em>really</em> need the <strong>best</strong> path between two points. You just <a href="http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=56">need something that’s close</a>. What you need may depend on what’s going on in the game, or how fast the computer is.</p><p>Suppose
 your game has two types of terrain, Flat and Mountain, and the movement
 costs are 1 for flat land and 3 for mountains, A* is going to search 
three times as far along flat land as it does along mountainous land. 
This is because it’s <em>possible</em> that there is a path along flat 
terrain that goes around the mountains. You can speed up A*’s search by 
using 1.5 as the heuristic distance between two map spaces. A* will then
 compare 3 to 1.5, and it won’t look as bad as comparing 3 to 1. It is 
not as dissatisfied with mountainous terrain, so it won’t spend as much 
time trying to find a way around it. Alternatively, you can speed up up 
A*’s search by decreasing the amount it searches for paths around 
mountains―just tell A* that the movement cost on mountains is 2 instead 
of 3. Now it will search only twice as far along the flat terrain as 
along mountainous terrain. Either approach gives up ideal paths to get 
something quicker.</p><p>The choice between speed and accuracy does not 
have to be static. You can choose dynamically based on the CPU speed, 
the fraction of time going into pathfinding, the number of units on the 
map, the importance of the unit, the size of the group, the difficulty 
level, or any other factor. One way to make the tradeoff dynamic is to 
build a heuristic function that assumes the minimum cost to travel one 
grid space is 1 and then build a cost function that scales:</p><pre class="snippet">g'(n) = 1 + alpha * (g(n) - 1)
</pre><p>If <code>alpha</code> is 0, then the modified cost function 
will always be 1. At this setting, terrain costs are completely ignored,
 and A* works at the level of simple passable/unpassable grid spaces. If
 <code>alpha</code> is 1, then the original cost function will be used, and you get the full benefit of A*. You can set <code>alpha</code> anywhere in between.</p><p>You should also consider switching from the heuristic returning the <em>absolute</em> minimum cost to returning the <em>expected</em>
 minimum cost. For example, if most of your map is grasslands with a 
movement cost of 2 but some spaces on the map are roads with a movement 
cost of 1, then you might consider having the heuristic assume no roads,
 and return <code>2 * distance</code>.</p><p>The choice between speed 
and accuracy does not have to be global. You can choose some things 
dynamically based on the importance of having accuracy in some region of
 the map. For example, it may be more important to choose a good path 
near the current location, on the assumption that we might end up 
recalculating the path or changing direction at some point, so why 
bother being accurate about the faraway part of the path? Or perhaps 
it’s not so important to have the shortest path in a safe area of the 
map, but when sneaking past an enemy village, safety and quickness are 
essential.</p></div><div class="h2banner"><h2 id="scale">Scale</h2><div class="h2-curl-bottom"></div><div class="h2-curl-top"></div></div><div class="topic"><p>A* computes <code>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</code>. To add two values, those two values need to be at the same scale. If <code>g(n)</code> is measured in hours and <code>h(n)</code> is measured in meters, then A* is going to consider <code>g</code> or <code>h</code> too much or too little, and you either won’t get as good paths or you A* will run slower than it could.</p></div><div class="h2banner"><h2 id="exact-heuristics">Exact heuristics</h2><div class="h2-curl-bottom"></div><div class="h2-curl-top"></div></div><div class="topic"><p>If
 your heuristic is exactly equal to the distance along the optimal path,
 you’ll see A* expand very few nodes, as in the diagram shown in <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#manhattan-distance">the next section</a>. What’s happening inside A* is that it is computing <code>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</code> at every node. When <code>h(n)</code> exactly matches <code>g(n)</code>, the value of <code>f(n)</code> doesn’t change along the path. All nodes not on the right path will have a higher value of <code>f</code> than nodes that are on the right path. Since A* doesn’t consider higher-valued <code>f</code> nodes until it has considered lower-valued <code>f</code> nodes, it never strays off the shortest path.</p><h3 id="precomputed-exact-heuristic">Precomputed exact heuristic</h3><p>One
 way to construct an exact heuristic is to precompute the length of the 
shortest path between every pair of points. This is not feasible for 
most game maps. However, there are ways to approximate this heuristic:</p><ul><li>Fit a coarse grid on top of the fine grid. Precompute the shortest path between any pair of coarse grid locations.</li><li>Precompute the shortest path between any pair of <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/MapRepresentations.html#waypoints">waypoints</a>. This is a generalization of the coarse grid approach.</li></ul><p>Then add in a heuristic <code>h'</code>
 that estimates the cost of going from any location to nearby waypoints.
 (The latter too can be precomputed if desired.) The final heuristic 
will be:</p><pre class="snippet">h(n) = h'(n, w1) + distance(w1, w2) + h'(w2, goal)
</pre><p>or if you want a better but more expensive heuristic, evaluate the above with all pairs <code>w1</code>, <code>w2</code> that are close to the node and the goal, respectively.</p><h3 id="linear-exact-heuristic">Linear exact heuristic</h3><p>In
 a special circumstance, you can make the heuristic exact without 
precomputing anything. If you have a map with no obstacles and no slow 
terrain, then the shortest path from the starting point to the goal 
should be a straight line.</p><p>If you’re using a simple heuristic (one
 which does not know about the obstacles on the map), it should match 
the exact heuristic. If it doesn’t, then you may have a problem with 
scale or the type of heuristic you chose.</p></div><div class="h2banner"><h2 id="heuristics-for-grid-maps">Heuristics for grid maps</h2><div class="h2-curl-bottom"></div><div class="h2-curl-top"></div></div><div class="topic"><p><span id="S7"></span> On a grid, there are well-known heuristic functions to use.</p><p><strong>Use the distance heuristic that matches the allowed movement:</strong></p><ul><li>On a square grid that allows <strong>4 directions</strong> of movement, use Manhattan distance (L<sub>1</sub>).</li><li>On a square grid that allows <strong>8 directions</strong> of movement, use Diagonal distance (L<sub>∞</sub>).</li><li>On a square grid that allows <strong>any direction</strong> of movement, you might or might not want Euclidean distance (L<sub>2</sub>).
 If A* is finding paths on the grid but you are allowing movement not on
 the grid, you may want to consider other representations of the map.</li><li>On a hexagon grid that allows <strong>6 directions</strong> of movement, use Manhattan distance <a href="http://3dmdesign.com/development/hexmap-coordinates-the-easy-way">adapted to hexagonal grids</a>.</li></ul><h3 id="manhattan-distance">Manhattan distance</h3><p>The standard heuristic for a square grid is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">Manhattan distance</a>. Look at your cost function and find the minimum cost <code>D</code> for moving from one space to an adjacent space. The heuristic on a square grid where you can move in 4 directions should be <code>D</code> times the Manhattan distance:</p><pre class="snippet">h(n) = D * (abs(n.x-goal.x) + abs(n.y-goal.y))
</pre><p>How do you pick D? Use a scale that matches your cost function.
 For the best paths, and an “admissible” heuristic, set D to the lowest 
cost between adjacent squares. In the absence of obstacles, and on 
terrain that has the minimum movement cost D, moving one step closer to 
the goal should <em>increase <code>g</code></em> by D and <em>decrease <code>h</code></em> by D. When you add the two, <code>f</code> (which is set to <code>g +
h</code>) will stay the same; that’s a sign that the heuristic and cost 
function scales match. You can also give up optimal paths to make A* run
 faster by increasing D, or by decreasing the ratio between the lowest 
and highest edge costs.</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/manhattan.png" alt="" height="226" width="526"></div><p>(Note: the above image has a <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html#breaking-ties">tie-breaker</a> added to the heuristic.}</p><h3 id="diagonal-distance">Diagonal distance</h3><p>If your map allows diagonal movement you need a different heuristic (sometimes called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance">Chebyshev distance</a>).
 The Manhattan distance for (4 east, 4 north) will be 8*D. However, you 
could simply move (4 northeast) instead, so the heuristic should be 4*D.
 This function handles diagonals, assuming that both straight and 
diagonal movement costs D:</p><pre class="snippet">h(n) = D * max(abs(n.x-goal.x), abs(n.y-goal.y))
</pre><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/diagonal.png" alt="" height="226" width="526"></div><p>If
 the cost of diagonal movement is not D, but something like D2 = 
sqrt(2)*D, the above heuristic won’t be right for you. You will instead 
want something more sophisticated:</p><pre class="snippet">h_diagonal(n) = min(abs(n.x-goal.x), abs(n.y-goal.y))
h_straight(n) = (abs(n.x-goal.x) + abs(n.y-goal.y))
h(n) = D2 * h_diagonal(n) + D * (h_straight(n) - 2*h_diagonal(n)))
</pre><p>Here we compute <code>h_diagonal(n) =</code> the number of steps you can take along a diagonal, <code>h_straight(n) =</code>
 the Manhattan distance, and then combine the two by considering all 
diagonal steps to cost D2, and then all remaining straight steps (note 
that this is the number of straight steps in the Manhattan distance, 
minus two straight steps for each diagonal step we took instead) cost D.</p><h3 id="euclidean-distance">Euclidean distance</h3><p>If your units can move at any angle (instead of grid directions), then you should probably use a straight line distance:</p><pre class="snippet">h(n) = D * sqrt((n.x-goal.x)^2 + (n.y-goal.y)^2)
</pre><p>However, if this is the case, then you may have trouble with using A* directly because the cost function <code>g</code> will not match the heuristic function <code>h</code>.
 Since Euclidean distance is shorter than Manhattan or diagonal 
distance, you will still get shortest paths, but A* will take longer to 
run:</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/euclidean.png" alt="" height="226" width="526"></div><h3 id="euclidean-distance-squared">Euclidean distance, squared</h3><p>I’ve
 seen several A* web pages recommend that you avoid the expensive square
 root in the Euclidean distance by just using distance-squared:</p><pre class="snippet">h(n) = D * ((n.x-goal.x)^2 + (n.y-goal.y)^2)
</pre><p><strong>Do not do this!</strong> This definitely runs into the scale problem. The scale of <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> need to match, because you’re adding them together to form <code>f</code>. When A* computes <code>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</code>, the square of distance will be much higher than the cost <code>g</code> and you will end up with an overestimating heuristic. For longer distances, this will approach the extreme of <code>g(n)</code> not contributing to <code>f(n)</code>, and A* will degrade into (Greedy) Best-First-Search:</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/best-first-search-trap.png" alt="" height="376" width="526"></div><p>To
 attempt to fix this you can scale the heuristic down. However, then you
 run into the opposite problem: for shorter distances, the heuristic 
will be too small compared to <code>g(n)</code> and A* will degrade into Dijkstra’s algorithm.</p><p>If,
 after profiling, you find the cost of the square root is significant, 
either use a fast square root approximation with Euclidean distance or 
use the diagonal distance as an approximation to Euclidean.</p><h3 id="breaking-ties">Breaking ties</h3><p>In
 some maps there are many paths with the same length. For example, in 
flat areas without variation in terrain, using a grid will lead to many 
equal-length paths. A* might explore all the paths with the same <code>f</code>
 value, instead of just one. (If you do have lots of such areas, there 
might be other techniques that are better than using A* on a grid.)</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/tie-breaking-off.png" alt="" height="351" width="491"><br> Ties in <code>f</code> values.<br></div><p>To solve this problem, we need to either adjust the <code>g</code> or <code>h</code> values; it is usually easier to adjust <code>h</code>. The tie breaker needs to be deterministic with respect to the vertex (<em>i.e.,</em> it shouldn’t just be a random number), and it needs to make the <code>f</code> values differ. Since A* sorts by <code>f</code> value, making them different means only one of the “equivalent” <code>f</code> values will be explored.</p><p>One way to break ties is to nudge the scale of <code>h</code> slightly. If we scale it downwards, then <code>f</code>
 will increase as we move towards the goal. Unfortunately, this means 
that A* will prefer to expand vertices close to the starting point 
instead of vertices close to the goal. We can instead scale <code>h</code> upwards slightly (even by 0.1%). A* will prefer to expand vertices close to the goal.</p><pre class="snippet">heuristic *= (1.0 + p)
</pre><p>The factor <code>p</code> should be chosen so that <code>p &lt;</code><em>(minimum cost of taking one step)</em><code>/</code><em>(expected maximum path length)</em>.
 Assuming that you don’t expect the paths to be more than 1000 steps 
long, you can choose p = 1/1000. The result of this tie-breaking nudge 
is that A* explores far less of the map than previously:</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/tie-breaking-scale-1.png" alt="" height="351" width="491"><br> Tie-breaking scaling added to heuristic.<br></div><p>When
 there are obstacles of course it still has to explore to find a way 
around them, but note that after the obstacle is passed, A* explores 
very little:</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/tie-breaking-scale-2.png" alt="" height="351" width="491"><br> Tie-breaking scaling added to heuristic, works nicely with obstacles.<br></div><p>Steven van Dijk suggests that a more straightforward way to do this would to pass <code>h</code> to the comparison function. When the <code>f</code> values are equal, the comparison function would break the tie by looking at <code>h</code>.</p><p>Another
 way to break ties is to compute a hash of the coordinates, and use that
 to adjust the heuristic. This breaks more ties than adjusting <code>h</code> as above. Thanks to Cris Fuhrman for suggesting this.</p><p>A different way to break ties is to prefer paths that are along the straight line from the starting point to the goal:</p><pre class="snippet">dx1 = current.x - goal.x
dy1 = current.y - goal.y
dx2 = start.x - goal.x
dy2 = start.y - goal.y
cross = abs(dx1*dy2 - dx2*dy1)
heuristic += cross*0.001
</pre><p>This code computes the vector cross-product between the start 
to goal vector and the current point to goal vector. When these vectors 
don’t line up, the cross product will be larger. The result is that this
 code will give some slight preference to a path that lies along the 
straight line path from the start to the goal. When there are no 
obstacles, A* not only explores less of the map, the path looks very 
nice as well:</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/tie-breaking-cross-1.png" alt="" height="351" width="491"><br> Tie-breaking cross-product added to heuristic, produces pretty paths.<br></div><p>However,
 because this tie-breaker prefers paths along the straight line from the
 starting point to the goal, weird things happen when going around 
obstacles (note that the path is still optimal; it just looks strange):</p><div class="figure"><img src="Heuristics_files/tie-breaking-cross-2.png" alt="" height="351" width="491"><br> Tie-breaking cross-product added to heuristic, less pretty with obstacles.<br></div><p>To interactively explore the improvement from this tie breaker, see <a href="http://www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/people/j.macgill/xaStar/">James Macgill’s A* applet</a> [or try <a href="http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/%7Ecvcourse/astar/AStar.html">this mirror</a> or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/www.ccg.leeds.ac.uk/james/aStar/">this mirror</a>].
 Use “Clear” to clear the map, and choose two points on opposite corners
 of the map. When you use the “Classic A*” method, you will see the 
effect of ties. When you use the “Fudge” method, you will see the effect
 of the above cross product added to the heuristic.</p><p>Yet another way to break ties is to carefully construct your A* priority queue so that <em>new</em> insertions with a specific <code>f</code> value are always ranked better (lower) than <em>old</em> insertions with the same <code>f</code> value.</p><p>You may also want to read about the <a href="http://home1.stofanet.dk/breese/papers.html">AlphA* algorithm</a>,
 which has a more sophisticated way to break ties, yet still maintain 
bounds on the optimality of the resulting path. AlphA* is adaptive and 
is likely to perform better than either of the two tie-breakers I 
described above. However, the tie-breakers I described are extremely 
easy to implement, so start with them first, and try AlphA* if you need 
something better.</p><h3 id="searching-for-an-area">Searching for an area</h3><p>If you want to search for any spot near some goal, instead of one particular space, you could construct a heuristic <code>h'(x)</code> that is the minimum of <code>h1(x), h2(x), h3(x), ...</code> where <code>h1, h2, h3</code>
 are heuristics to each of the nearby spots. However, a faster way is to
 just let A* search for the center of the goal area. Once you pull <em>any</em> nearby space from the OPEN set, you can stop and construct a path.</p></div><div class="astar-nav"><span>Back: <a rel="prev" href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html">Introduction to A*</a></span><span>Up: <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/index.html">Home</a></span><span>Next: <a rel="next" href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/ImplementationNotes.html">Implementation</a></span></div></div><div class="divider"></div><div class="divider-disqus" style="font-size:large">
