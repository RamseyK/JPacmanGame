This is a basic implementation of Pacman in Java using standard libraries shipped with JDK 1.6. I wrote this in a few hours for a Computer Science course and I have no plans to continue to work on it. This program can be a great starting point for those wanting to learn about any of the features below...

----

= Features =
  * Pacman game play
  * Level editor
  * All game graphics and animation performed by Java's AWT
  * Editor UI written with Swing
  * AStar Path Finding (see links below)
  * Tile based map with smooth movement
  * Extensible AIManager
  * Game Object inheritance hierarchy
  * An intelligent, single threaded, design with a program state model
  * Commented and easy to follow code

= TODO =
Feel free to fill in any of the missing features I did not bother with
  * Unimplemented Pacman quirks (see links below)
  * Ghost personalities (see quirks)
  * Cutscenes
  * Remove 'debug' related toggles and code
  * Ghost eye-movement
  * Better controls for the map editor
  * Fix the scoreboard
  * Better heuristic & cost calculation for path finding
  * A Sound Manager
  * Scale down when resolution is below 1280x1024. Scales up well
