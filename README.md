This is a basic implementation of Pacman in Java using standard libraries shipped with JDK 1.6. I wrote this in a few hours for a Computer Science course and I have no plans to continue to work on it. This program can be a great starting point for those wanting to learn about any of the features below.

# Features
* Pacman game play
* Level / Map editor
* All game graphics and animation performed by Java's AWT
* Editor UI written with Swing
* AStar Path Finding (see links below)
* Tile based map with smooth movement
* Extensible AI Manager
* Commented and easy to follow code

# Unimplemented
* Unimplemented Pacman quirks (see links below)
* Ghost personalities (see quirks)
* Cutscenes
* Remove 'debug' related toggles and code
* Ghost eye-movement
* Better controls for the map editor
* Fix the scoreboard
* Better heuristic & cost calculation for path finding
* Sound
* Scale down when resolution is below 1280x1024. Scales up well
